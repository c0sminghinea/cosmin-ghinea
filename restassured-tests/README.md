# RestAssured API Testing Project

This project demonstrates API testing for RESTful services using **RestAssured**, a robust Java library for API testing. The project is built with **Maven** for dependency management and uses **TestNG** for test execution, complemented by **Allure Reports** for clear and detailed test reporting.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (JDK 8 or later)
- **RestAssured** (v5.5.0): Simplifies writing and maintaining API test cases.
- **Maven**: Dependency and build management.
- **TestNG**: For structured test execution and parallelism.
- **Allure Reports**: For generating detailed and interactive reports.

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Java**: Ensure JDK 8 or later is installed.
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
2. **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed.
   ```bash
   mvn -v
   ```
3. **Allure Command-Line Tool**: Install Allure for report generation.
   Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline).

4. **IDE**: Use IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for development.

---

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd restassured-tests
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Configure Test Data**
   Update any necessary configuration files (e.g., API endpoints, payloads) located in `src/test/resources`.

---

## Running Tests

1. **Run All Tests**
   Execute the complete test suite:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

2. **Run Specific Tests**
    - Via Maven:
      ```bash
      mvn -Dtest=<TestClassName> test
      ```
    - Via IDE: Right-click on a test class or method and select **Run**.

3. **Parallel Test Execution**
   Modify `testng.xml` to configure parallel execution as needed.

## Approach and Tech Stack

### Why RestAssured?
RestAssured simplifies API testing by providing a fluent API that allows for easily building requests, verifying responses, and handling authentication. It integrates seamlessly with Java, making it a reliable choice for API testing in enterprise-level projects.

### Why Maven and TestNG?
- **Maven** provides powerful dependency management and a standardized project structure.
- **TestNG** enables structured test execution, grouping, and parallel testing, making it an ideal choice for scalable test automation.

### Reporting with Allure
Allure Reports offer detailed insights into test execution, including steps, attachments, and logs, making it easier to debug and analyze results.

## Generating Reports

1. **Run Tests**  
   Ensure the tests generate Allure results (configured by default to output in `/allure-results`).

2. **Generate and View Allure Report**
   ```bash
   allure serve allure-results
   ```
   This command will start a local server and display the report in your browser.

## Key Features
- **Test Scenarios**
    - **Create**: Add a new resource (e.g., "Pet") and verify its creation.
    - **Retrieve**: Fetch and validate resource details.
    - **Update**: Modify an existing resource.
    - **Delete**: Remove a resource and handle edge cases (e.g., `404 Not Found`).

- **Error Handling**: Verifies API responses, including positive and negative scenarios.

- **Reusable Utilities**: Shared methods for requests, assertions, and logging.
